# Digital Image Processing Course

A website dedicated to helping students learn Digital Image Processing (DIP) from its very basics. This project started as a personal interest but has now evolved into a full-fledged initiative aimed at making DIP accessible and understandable for students. The platform will feature interactive elements that allow users to visualize and engage with various image processing functions, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
